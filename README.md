# Per-residue-contact-analysis
Per residue contact analysis integrated over the course of a molecular simulation.

detailed_matrix.py builds upon contact_matrix.py and rather than calculate distances for CA, this considers each residue's R groups. For future release, include a visual description of what atoms have been selected.

Updated for python 3.x
